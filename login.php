 * Applied cryptography project - a postquantum messenger application
 * January 2017
 * This solution was submitted and prepared by Anna Dorottya Simon(R48G73), Márk Szabó(EMX74N) for the project assignment of the Applied cryptography project seminar course.
 * We declare that this solution is our own work.
 * We have put the necessary references wherever we have used bigger and/or complicated external codes in our project. For shorter code snippets (usually from Stack Overflow) we have put the reference there in most cases.
 * Given the uniqueness of the project (no other student had, have or will have the same project) we have published our code on GitHub with the permission of our professors.
 * Students’ regulation of Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C. § ) states that as long as a student presents another student’s work - or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own performance, it will count as a disciplinary fault. The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal of the student from the University.
